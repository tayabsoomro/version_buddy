# Introduction

version_buddy is a script that renames files in the old format
(Name_Major_Minor.Ext) to the new format (Name.Major.Minor.Ext). The script takes
one argument on the command line, the name of an existing file in the old format.
The script performs a number of checks, and if they succeed, it renames to file
to the corresponding name in the new format.
