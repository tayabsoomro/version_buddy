# Program: version_buddy

# Introduction

version_buddy is a script that renames files in the old format
(Name_Major_Minor.Ext) to the new format (Name.Major.Minor.Ext). The script takes
one argument on the command line, the name of an existing file in the old format.
The script performs a number of checks, and if they succeed, it renames to file
to the corresponding name in the new format.

# Program Exit Error Codes
0 - Exit Successful
1 - Invalid Arguments
2 - File does not exist
3 - File not well-formed
4 - Destination file already exists

# Program Outline

The program only takes on parameter and that is the name of the file that needs
to be converted from the old format scheme to the new one. The program does few
checks and then if successful, it changes the file name to the new naming scheme.
The first check that it does is that whether or not the filename provided follows
the old scheme, if it does, then it does another check for whether or not the file
actually exists, if it does then it renames the file, and in any other case, it
throws an error and exits the program with appropriate exist status.


# Program Structure

The program mainly consists of multiple functions and they're called to do the
operations. For example, first of all, the program checks to see if the number
or arguments provided is not 1, if so, then it calls the usage function which
explains the syntax of how the program is to be used. Otherwise, the program calls
the function convert_filename_scheme which does all the checks and if the checks
are successful, then it renames the file. There are functions for checks such as
is_old_scheme (returns 1 if true, 0 otherwise) and file_exists (returns 1 if
true, 0 otherwise)
